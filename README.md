[00:03.07] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[00:05.98] Nah
[00:07.48] 
[00:09.61] Ask you once, ask you twice now
[00:12.07] There's lipstick on your collar
[00:14.20] You say she's just a friend now
[00:16.55] Then why don't we call her?
[00:18.84] So you wanna go home with someone
[00:20.85] To do all the things you used to do to me
[00:23.67] I swear, I know you do
[00:34.67] 
[00:26.67] Used to take me out, in your fancy car
[00:29.14] And make out in the rain
[00:31.37] And when I ring you up
[00:32.67] Don't know where you are
[00:33.68] 'Til I hear her say your name
[00:35.93] Used to sing along, when you played guitar
[00:38.13] That's a distant memory
[00:40.38] Hope she treats you better than you treated me, ha
[01:05.38] 
[00:44.36] I'm onto you, yeah, you
[00:47.42] I'm not your number one
[00:49.27] I saw you, with her
[00:51.82] Kissing and having fun
[00:54.16] If you're giving her all of your money and time
[00:56.40] I'm not gonna sit here wasting mine on you, yeah, you

[01:15.61] Why did I bother?
[01:17.79] Tell me how many more times
[01:20.03] Does it take to get smarter?
[01:22.22] Don't need to deny the hurt and the lies
[01:24.67] And all of the things you did to me
[01:27.02] I swear, I know you did
[01:38.52] 
[01:30.03] Now you take her out, in your fancy car
[01:32.54] And you make out in the rain
[01:34.53] And when she rings you up
[01:35.89] She know where you are
[01:37.19] But I know differently
[01:39.29] Now she sings along, when you play guitar
[01:41.56] Making brand new memories
[01:43.76] Hope you treat her better than you treated me
